# Reduced-Instruction-Set-Computer

- Developed a Datapath that utilized pipeline registers, source operand and writeback multiplexers, along with an arithmetic logic unit to perform operations on 16-bit entrees
- Supplemented a finite state machine controller to automate process of executing instructions on Datapath
- Appended memory to hold instructions along with data and extended interface to communicate with text files
- Simulated testbenches to analyze waveforms to ensure proper functionality and execution of code
